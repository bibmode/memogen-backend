**Note: Delete this note and update the table of contents based on what sections you keep.**

## Overview

### The challenge:
- Perform the adding of user/s to SQL database with limited privileges (own choice) via web-based interface.
- Develop a web-based login page for the authentication of users before the system's access.
- Create a webpage that will display the user's assigned privileges every after successful entry to the system.

### APIs' features:
- Get the tasks and notes of the user logged in
- Post new task and memo to the database under the user's id
- Update tasks' and memos' details by their ids
- Get tasks and notes by inputted keywords

**Note: I will be deploying this entire app in the future. I have a limited time to deploy it on heroku which I have not used before since the deadline of this school project is later this day @ 12:00 am 2021-11-28. To use it for now, follow the instructions in the How-to-use section.**

## My process

### Built with

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) - For connecting the backend to the frontend
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - Database service
- [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) - For HTTP server
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - For token authentication

### What I learned

In the process of this project, I learned a lot of things. Here are some of them:
- Connecting the sql database to the front end using api calls
- Binding data from user's input in the UI to php
- Making POST, GET, UPDATE, and DELETE queries
- How to debug in php using echo calls 

### Useful resources

- [React JS + PHP + MySQL DB Login & Registration System](https://www.w3jar.com/react-js-php-mysql-db-login-registration-system/) - This helped me create the loginand registration system of this app.
- [Getting started with React.js & PHP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGIrau9dW4&t=99s&ab_channel=Keith%2CtheCoder) - This is an amazing video that helped me in connecting my frontend folder to the backend folder using react and php


## Acknowledgments

Thank you to Sir Mark Phil B. Pacot, our IT107 professor, who gave this project as our assignment. This was a great learning experience for me and I'm sure I'll be able to use what I learned in this project in my next CRUD applications.
