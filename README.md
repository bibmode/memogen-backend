## Overview

### The challenge:
- Perform the adding of user/s to SQL database with limited privileges (own choice) via web-based interface.
- Develop a web-based login page for the authentication of users before the system's access.
- Create a webpage that will display the user's assigned privileges every after successful entry to the system.

### APIs should be able to:
- Get the tasks and notes of the user logged in
- Post new task and memo to the database under the user's id
- Update tasks' and memos' details by their ids
- Get tasks and notes by inputted keywords

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: I will be deploying this entire app in the future. I have a limited time to deploy it on heroku which I have not used before since the deadline of this school project is later this day @ 12:00 am 2021-11-28. To use it for now, follow the instructions in the How-to-use section.**
